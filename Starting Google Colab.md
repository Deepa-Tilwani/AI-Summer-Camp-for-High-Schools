(This Colaboratory is divided into 2 Sessions to complete with link provided as HW to review.)

## Step 4 : Saving Notebooks To GitHub or Drive

Any time you open a GitHub hosted notebook in Colab, it opens a new editable view of the notebook. 
You can run and modify the notebook without worrying about overwriting the source.

If you would like to save your changes from within Colab, you can use the File menu to save the modified notebook either to Google Drive or back to GitHub. 
Choose File→Save a copy in Drive or File→Save a copy to GitHub and follow the resulting prompts. 
To save a Colab notebook to GitHub requires giving Colab permission to push the commit to your repository.
