## Bonus for today... Review more Python Videos...


We suggest going through a series of [python programming lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) provided by [Software Carpentries](http://software-carpentry.org/), tailored specifically for individuals working with data in research domains. 
These lessons serve as an excellent introduction to python and will swiftly equip you with the skills needed to analyze data. 
For our sessions, we will be utilizing [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for python programming, and we encourage you to use it while completing these tutorials. 
To get started, we recommend watching the Neuromatch Academy [short video on Getting started with Python: Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFroq4SuSPM&feature=youtu.be) which guides you through opening Google Colab, 
importing data files, and tackling initial exercises. Once you have completed that, we highly recommend exploring sections 6-9 of [other software carpentries python course](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), which familiarizes you with crucial python libraries for data analysis and plotting. 
Remember to import the data files into Google Colab, and refer to the linked video for an exampl
